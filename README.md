# 👋 Hi, I'm Divine Obeten

> *Frontend Developer | Builder at Heart | Exploring Blockchain & Systems Tech*

I'm Divine, a JavaScript developer focused on crafting sleek, interactive UIs with React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I build fast, expressive frontends and enjoy exploring how motion, layout, and detail can shape great user experiences.

Recently, I've been deepening my technical range with Rust, experimenting with Web3 technologies, and building tools that solve real problems.

🧭 Currently Focus
- Growing beyond frontend frameworks by exploring systems programming with Rust and blockchain technologies.
- Exploring smart contract development and decentralized app architecture.
- Building and shipping my own SaaS tools.
- Creating interactive UI experiences with animation, motion, and interaction in mind.

### 🧰 Tools I Work With
```ts
JavaScript · TypeScript · React · Next.js · Tailwind CSS · GSAP · Framer Motion · Rust · Solidity
