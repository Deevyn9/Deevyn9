> *Frontend Developer | Builder at Heart | Exploring Blockchain & Systems Tech*

I got into frontend development during a school break, curious at first, but building those early Frontend Mentor challenges got me hooked. I loved turning designs into interactive experiences and learning how each detail could shape how a site feels. Now, I build fast, expressive frontends with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and enjoy exploring how motion, layout, and detail can shape great user experiences. Lately, I’ve been diving into Rust and Web3, always learning and building.

🧭 Currently Focus
- Growing beyond frontend frameworks by exploring systems programming with Rust and blockchain technologies.
- Exploring smart contract development and decentralized app architecture.
- Building and shipping my own SaaS tools.
- Creating interactive UI experiences with animation, motion, and interaction in mind.

### 🧰 Tools I Work With
```ts
JavaScript · TypeScript · React · Next.js · Tailwind CSS · GSAP · Framer Motion · Rust · Solidity
